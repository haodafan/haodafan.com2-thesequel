# Haoda Fan Dot Com 2 - The Sequel (In Development) 
Haoda Fan Dot Com's long awaited sequel is finally here! After weeks of being down thanks to me not knowing how to use servers, I have decided to give this making a website thing a try once again! 

## Introduction

Sequels are always a hard. They get easy approval from publishers and Hollywood because they will almost universially make a profit thanks to the Mere Exposure Effect. Unfortunately, it also means it comes with very high expectations, as old and new fans alike will have a very specific idea in mind of what they want the sequel to be like.

Good thing the original Haoda Fan Dot Com is low quality garbage that nobody cared about so we're setting the bar unreasonably low for myself! HAHAH- CHECKMATE, TRYHARDS!

## Development

Haoda Fan Dot Com 2 - The Sequel will be developed with AS

I plan on using the following technologies to help me in this endeavour:
- ASP.NET 2.1 Core
- SCSS (because CSS kinda sucks)

I plan on implementing the following features:
- Some static pages for exposition dumps (About me page [NOT STARTED], Hire-me page [IN DEVELOPMENT], etc) [IN DEVELOPMENT]
- Dynamic pages to showcase my projects [NOT STARTED]
- Some kind of Dynamic homepage [NOT STARTED]
- A Blog [TO BE HONEST I DONT EVEN REALLY KNOW WHAT A BLOG IS]
- A Gallery for art and photos [NOT STARTED]
- Some kind of feed that pulls things from a database. And when I say things I mean ... memes. I am a cool guy.

## Your website is SO COOL, I want to contribute to it!!!

### How can I help you make your website? 

Well, this is the first time I used ASP.NET Core. So if you're an export (or have any experience at all), please help meeeee! 

I do actually have a few questions for ASP.NET Core experts out there... 

**FAQ EXCEPT IM THE ONE ASKING AND YOU'RE THE ONE THAT HAS TO ANSWER ME**

**Q:** What files should I include in my .gitignore? Are there any files that don't need to be in the repository (like if this was made with Node.JS, I would put node_modules in it)? 

**Q:** What the hell is a blog?
