        <h2>10. I am a student at the University of Waterloo </h2>
        <br>
        <p> Studying Computer Science at one of Canada's top STEM schools with undeniably the best co-op program in the country.</p>

        <h2>9. I have 8 months of work experience already under my belt </h2>
        <p>Thanks to coop, I have already worked as a software developer for 8 months total at two different jobs: </p>
        <ul>

        <h2>7. I am a try-hard</h2>
        <p>
            At least I try pretty hard to be. I know a lot of people like to make fun of or look down on 'try-hard's, but I respect them.
            You don't get anywhere in life if you don't try.

        <h2>6. I take criticism like I take food. I take it well. </h2>
        <p>
            I like to imagine a graph of the line y = -(1/x) except only the right side of it, where 0 represents perfection,
            and the x axis represents the amount of effort put into reaching it. Notice that it gets asymptotically close to perfection,
            but it can never reach it. There's always something to improve on, to do better with. That applies to anything I do in life.
            Now, I'm no where near perfect, far far from it. That's why I need all the help I can get, in the form of constructive criticism.

        <h2>3. I am a good communicator and public speaker</h2>
        <p>
            Whether you need someone for a presentation or even just someone who knows how to communicate clearly, I am the right person.
            Communication is often a skill that I find is undervalued by students in CS, but I know how important it is in any position or
            industry. That's why I put a lot of effort into improving and honing my skills in communication, which includes public speaking,
            writing, and interpersonal communication.

        <h2>2. I have a positive, optimistic, wholesome attitude in general</h2>
        <p>It's kind of hard for things to really get to me. I deal with stress pretty well and tend to think things will eventually work out.
        I'm usually right. </p>

        <h2>1. I have a Tyrian-purple Resume</h2>
        <p>
            In the times of Ancient Rome, purple dye was an extreme rarity. They were produced by grinding rare snails found on the
            extreme east coast of the mediterranean sea (around Israel and Lebanon). As a result, only the most powerful and wealthy people,
            like Roman Emperors, could afford to wear them. Tyrian-purple was the colour that symbolized the amazing wealth and power of
            Roman Emperors and their Empire.

            I, much like Roman Emperors, use purple as a symbol of the wealth. It represents the wealth I could generate at your company if
            you hired me. So that's why my resume is purple. Please <a href="#">have a look!</a>"
