        Although to be honest, I'm not really that sure what to put here. I'm thinking of making some sort of meme feed (lol I'm so cool) 
        where I just put a bunch of images that make me laugh here. Maybe I'll make a database and have it dynamically load in memes. Yeah... 
        that will certainly make employers take me seriously!
